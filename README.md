# Please-Stop-Permuting-Features

This is my implementation of the article "Please Stop Permuting Features: An Explanation and Alternatives" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03151?context=stat.ML). Note that not all of the results from the article exists in my implementation, I implement that which I find interesting or want to understand on a deeper level.

Not that this implementation is my own but I upload the code here to help others that might see how others understood the article and how they recreated the results.
